    Holdin' me back
               <b>Bm</b>
    Gravity's holdin' me back
                   <b>E</b>
    I want you to hold
    
    Out the palm of your hand
                  <b>A</b>
    Why don't we leave it at that?
     <b>D</b>
    Nothin' to say
                    <b>Bm</b>
    And everything gets in the way

    "Harry, you're no good alone
                 <b>E</b>
    Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
                <b>A</b>
    What kinda pills are you on?"
     <b>D</b>
    Ringin' the bell
                  <b>Bm</b>
    And nobody's coming to help
                <b>E</b>
    Your daddy lives by himself
